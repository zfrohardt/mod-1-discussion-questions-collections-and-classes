# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?
# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
